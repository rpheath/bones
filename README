Bones, the simple HTML mockup framework.

What it does:

  - Provides a simple framework for creating views
    without worrying about controllers
  - Allows the building of a complete static website
    out of views, partials, and layouts which can
    then be combined into full HTML pages for deployment
    onto ANY webserver.

Requirements:

  - ActiveSupport
  - rack

Starting it up:

	- Clone:
	  mkdir my_bones_app
	  cd my_bones_app
    git clone git://github.com/scharfie/bones.git
  
  - Initialization
    ruby bones/init.rb
    
  - Serve
    rake server
 
  - Browse:
    http://localhost:3000

  
Flatten your views into .html files:

	- Cache
    rake cache:simple     # without versioning
    rake cache:versioned  # with versioning

  Then upload the entire public/ directory to your server.
